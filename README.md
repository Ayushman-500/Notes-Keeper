# Notes Keeper
I learned to build this web application in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course. 

- This web application imitates the basic functionalities of Google Keep to add and delete notes. 
- It is structured on React framework and implemented using itâ€™s core concepts like components and props, rendering elements, event handling, conditional rendering, hooks, forms, state and lifecycle.
